Developed a Multi Splay Tree, an advanced binary search tree. Achieved competitive access time bounds of O(log log n).
– Optimizing performance for specific search sequences with up to 20% faster access times compared to traditional splay trees.
– Examined and evaluated performance on multiple search sequences, demonstrating superior runtime for frequently accessed
nodes.
